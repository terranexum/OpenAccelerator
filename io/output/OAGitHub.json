At present, a Cyan will remove over the course of 24 hours the same amount of CO2 emitted by running a 9-watt LED bulb for 3 hours. That is 2 grams of CO2 for 10 grams of input material - or a 0.2:1 ratio. It is within theoretical possibility for this unit to remove the emissions of 20 9-watt LED bulbs for 3 hours (a whole house at night), that is 0.382 kg of CO2 that would need to be captured. "

The calcium hydroxide needs to be exposed to high humidity from between 3 to 16 hours to achieve a good level of carbonation. Keeping the electricity consumption low will ensure Cyan removes more CO2 than it emits through electricity use. Cyan uses 1.5 watts of electricity to power the air pump which bubbles air through water and humidifies the calcium hydroxide, allowing CO2 to be absorbed. However, the air pump does not need to be run continuously to maintain adequate humidification. "

The fan uses 3 watts but only needs to be run intermittently to refresh the air inside the box. The fan is also useful to speed up dry time but this is not essential for operation. If you're going for negative emissions, air drying would really help unless you are using renewable energy to power your unit.
