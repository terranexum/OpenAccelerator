The educational experience might be the biggest way that Cyan units will combat climate change. One can quickly see what CO2 emissions look like in trapped form, how much it weighs, and how long it takes to capture it. DACC starts to become a conversation point among friends and family.

The input material, calcium hydroxide, can be found in any home improvement store as hydrated lime. However, for Cyan to be carbon-negative the input must either be sourced from a low-carbon supplier or obtained from waste cement. The output material, calcium carbonate can be used in building materials (cement-lime) or as agricultural lime. Magnesium hydroxide is also an option for use as the input material. Though perhaps more expensive depending on the source, it is less alkaline than calcium hydroxide and has performed as well to slightly better than calcium hydroxide in carbon capture effectiveness in our Cyan tests.

            "description": " Lastly, to view Cyan Project Progress updates on the OpenAir Forum, those are available here. The input material, calcium hydroxide, can be found in any home improvement store as hydrated lime. However, for Cyan to be carbon-negative the input must either be sourced from a low-carbon supplier or obtained from waste cement. The output material, calcium carbonate can be used in building materials (cement-lime) or as agricultural lime. Magnesium hydroxide is also an option for use as the input material. Though perhaps more expensive depending on the source, it is less alkaline than calcium hydroxide and has performed as well to slightly better than calcium hydroxide in carbon capture effectiveness in our Cyan tests.

At present, a Cyan will remove over the course of 24 hours the same amount of CO2 emitted by running a 9-watt LED bulb for 3 hours. That is 2 grams of CO2 for 10 grams of input material - or a 0.2:1 ratio. It is within theoretical possibility for this unit to remove the emissions of 20 9-watt LED bulbs for 3 hours (a whole house at night), that is 0.382 kg of CO2 that would need to be captured. "

The calcium hydroxide needs to be exposed to high humidity from between 3 to 16 hours to achieve a good level of carbonation. Keeping the electricity consumption low will ensure Cyan removes more CO2 than it emits through electricity use. Cyan uses 1.5 watts of electricity to power the air pump which bubbles air through water and humidifies the calcium hydroxide, allowing CO2 to be absorbed. However, the air pump does not need to be run continuously to maintain adequate humidification. "
