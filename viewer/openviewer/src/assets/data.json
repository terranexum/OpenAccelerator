Abstract: Though carbon dioxide is a waste product of combustion, it can also be a potential feedstock for the production of fine and commodity organic chemicals, provided that an efficient means to convert it to useful organic synthons can be developed. Herein we report a common element, nanostructured catalyst for the direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to ethanol with high Faradaic efficiency (63 % at 1.2 V vs RHE) and high selectivity (84 %) that operates in water and at ambient temperature and pressure. Lacking noble metals or other rare or expensive materials, the catalyst is comprised of Cu nanoparticles on a highly textured, N-doped carbon nanospike film. Electrochemical analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a preliminary mechanism in which active sites on the Cu nanoparticles and the carbon nanospikes work in tandem to control the electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide dimer to alcohol. Abstract: We report new insights into the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on a metallic copper surface, enabled by the development of an experimental methodology with unprecedented sensitivity for the identification and quantification of CO2 electroreduction products.

Electrochemical based carbon capture utilization systems can perform carbon and utilization both at a room temperature and pressure which allows for rapid modularity and scalability. During our time in developing this technology stack, we realized that some of the biggest problems and breakthroughs are required in the field of catalyst design. What if we could accelerate the catalyst development through a unique implementation of open source hardware? The Air-Synth prototype consists of two main components: In order to utilize and convert CO2 to other chemicals, we have had two changes to the conventional PEM based electrolyser design. We went ahead with a zero gap electrolyser design. A zero gap electrolyser design reduces the size of the PEM cell while keeping the size of the membrane the same, while making the entire system modular and stackable. "

This allows the membrane to be exposed directly to the ambient air and start capturing the CO2 from the atmosphere. There are still some variable parameters to be worked out in terms of the carbon capture system, but as a first step we will only be focusing on converting CO2 to useful chemicals. The first one being CO, in the coming months we will be doing more tests where we try to convert CO2 to Ethanol and Ethylene. This would require a modification of the catalyst at atomic levels that we have currently used for the conversion of CO2 to CO. "

I am currently drying it with a fan, will give it 24 hours to dry completely, then test it in the sorbent tester tomorrow.   NOTE: If there was lost sorbent in these washes from the nut milk bag, it was undetectable to me.

Abstract: Though carbon dioxide is a waste product of combustion, it can also be a potential feedstock for the production of fine and commodity organic chemicals, provided that an efficient means to convert it to useful organic synthons can be developed. Herein we report a common element, nanostructured catalyst for the direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to ethanol with high Faradaic efficiency (63 % at 1.2 V vs RHE) and high selectivity (84 %) that operates in water and at ambient temperature and pressure. Lacking noble metals or other rare or expensive materials, the catalyst is comprised of Cu nanoparticles on a highly textured, N-doped carbon nanospike film. Electrochemical analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a preliminary mechanism in which active sites on the Cu nanoparticles and the carbon nanospikes work in tandem to control the electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide dimer to alcohol. Abstract: We report new insights into the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on a metallic copper surface, enabled by the development of an experimental methodology with unprecedented sensitivity for the identification and quantification of CO2 electroreduction products.

Abstract: Electrochemical CO2 reduction to liquid multi-carbon alcohols provides a promising way for intermittent renewable energy reservation and greenhouse effect mitigation. Cu\u03b4+ (0<\u03b4<1) species on Cu-based electrocatalysts can produce ethanol, but the in situ formed Cu\u03b4+ is insufficient and easily reduced to Cu0. Here a Cu2S1\u2212x catalyst with abundant Cu\u03b4+ (0<\u03b4<1) species is designedly synthesized and exhibited an ultra-low over-potential of 0.19 V for ethanol production. The catalyst not only delivers an outstanding ethanol selectivity of 86.9 % and a Faradaic efficiency of 73.3 % but also provides a long-term stability of Cu\u03b4+, gaining an economic profit based on techno-economic analysis.

Alex observes that Node.js is an example of this - an open source tool has evolved into a widely used standard.

Electrochemical based carbon capture utilization systems can perform carbon and utilization both at a room temperature and pressure which allows for rapid modularity and scalability. During our time in developing this technology stack, we realized that some of the biggest problems and breakthroughs are required in the field of catalyst design. What if we could accelerate the catalyst development through a unique implementation of open source hardware? The Air-Synth prototype consists of two main components: In order to utilize and convert CO2 to other chemicals, we have had two changes to the conventional PEM based electrolyser design. We went ahead with a zero gap electrolyser design. A zero gap electrolyser design reduces the size of the PEM cell while keeping the size of the membrane the same, while making the entire system modular and stackable. "

There are still some variable parameters to be worked out in terms of the carbon capture system, but as a first step we will only be focusing on converting CO2 to useful chemicals. The first one being CO, in the coming months we will be doing more tests where we try to convert CO2 to Ethanol and Ethylene. This would require a modification of the catalyst at atomic levels that we have currently used for the conversion of CO2 to CO. "
